# ü©ª MPR Viewer
**Multi-Planar Reconstruction Viewer for Medical Imaging**
# üß† Overview
**MPR Viewer** (Multi-Planar Reconstruction Viewer) is a powerful desktop application built with **Python** and **PyQt5** that allows users to **view , analyze ,and interact** with medical imaging data such as **DICOM** and **NIfTI** scans.
It reconstructs 3D medical images and displays them in multiple planes **‚Äî Axial, Coronal, Sagittal, and Oblique ‚Äî** providing doctors, students, and researchers with a precise way to explore medical data.
# ‚öôÔ∏è Features
‚Ä¢ **Data Import**   
Load **NIfTI (.nii, .nii.gz)** files or **DICOM** folders (multi-slice series)     
‚Ä¢ **Multi-Planar Views**       
View synchronized **Axial, Coronal, Sagittal**, and **Oblique** slices simultaneously.         
‚Ä¢ **Interactive Tools**         
Zoom, Pan, Crop, and adjust Contrast dynamically using the mouse.          
‚Ä¢ **Cine Mode**          
Automatically scroll through slices (like a playback animation).      
‚Ä¢ **Crosshair Synchronization**       
Crosshair moves in real-time across all viewing planes.        
‚Ä¢ **Automatic Orientation & Intensity Handling**           
Uses DICOM **WindowCenter/WindowWidth** and spacing metadata for accurate reconstruction.       
‚Ä¢ **3D Transformations**        
Rotation and oblique slicing supported for advanced visualization.       
‚Ä¢ **Image Correction**        
Automatic left‚Äìright flipping and sorting for proper anatomical alignment.       
‚Ä¢ **Modern Dark-Mode UI**         
Custom QSS styling with clean design and smooth contrast.        
‚Ä¢ **Export**       
Save processed data back to **DICOM** or **NIfTI** format.
